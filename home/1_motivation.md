# 1. Motivation

I already know how to 'code' in JavaScript. But I don't know how to 
program, i.e. I don't know JavaScript deeply.

I think JavaScript is useful for all kinds of GUI apps, because of 
it's interplay with HTML, in addition to having a robust backend 
ecosystem powered by [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js).

A more fine grained (and limited) reason is that even if JavaScript 
is not used for all GUIs, it is still a good candidate for web apps, 
which are an essential class of GUI apps.

This makes an understanding of JavaScript very important.
